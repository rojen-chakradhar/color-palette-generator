# 🎨 Color Palette Generator
A sleek, minimalist web application that generates cohesive color schemes at the click of a button. Built with raw power and no heavy frameworks — just pure web fundamentals.

## ⚡ The Concept
Finding the perfect color combination can be the hardest part of design. This project removes the friction by generating randomized, high-contrast hex codes and applying them to a live preview.

This project was built to explore DOM manipulation and the logic of hexadecimal randomization in JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Built With
HTML5: Semantic structure for the UI.

CSS3: Flexbox layout and smooth transition animations.

JavaScript (ES6+): Logic for color generation and real-time UI updates.

## 🚀 Features
Instant Generation: One click creates a brand-new 4-color palette.

Hex Display: Automatically shows the generated Hex code for easy copying.

Responsive Design: Works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Visual Feedback: Dynamic text coloring to ensure hex codes remain readable against light/dark backgrounds.

## 📂 Project Structure
├── index.html      # The skeleton & UI
├── style.css       # Layout, colors, and animations
└── script.js      # The "brain" (Randomization logic)

## 🧠 How it Works
The generator uses a JavaScript function to loop through an array of 16 hexadecimal characters. It generates a string starting with # followed by 6 random characters for each of the 4 boxes.
